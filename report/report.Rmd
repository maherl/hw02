#Abstract
A report detailing the performance of a simple regression analysis, based on the examples given in chapter 3 of the book **An Introduction to Statistical Learning**. In this report, we reproduce some of the graphics and statistics included in that chapter.

#Introduction
The overarching goal of the project is to increase sales of the product. In order to do this, we undertake analysis to see whether there is a concrete relationship between sales and amount of money spent on advertising. This advertising is split into three different media formats: TV, Radio and Newspaper. By developing a model which predicts sales based on funds allotted to each media domain, we can determine the optimal allocation of funds and achieve the greatest amount of sales. 

#Data
We are using the dataset given in the book entitled "Advertising.csv". It contains the data for 200 different markets, with the amount spent on TV, Radio and Newspaper advetising (in thousands of dollars) and the amount of sales this spending produced (in thousands of units).

#Methodology
In this project, we are focuing on the media of TV and analysing its relationship with Sales.
To carry out this analysis, we are using the simple model: Sales = (Beta0) + (Beta2)TV.
These coefficients are estimted with regression and least-squares in R.

#Results
Here is a table with the resulting co-efficient values:
```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
names(dimnames(reg_coefficients)) <- list("", "Table 1:Information about Regression Coefficients")
reg_coefficients
```
This tells us that our estimate for Beta0 is 7.03 and for Beta1 it is 0.0475. This means that for every additional $1000 spent on TV advertising, we would expect approximately 47.5 additional TVs to be sold (and that below having $7000 spent on advertising, we wouldn't expect to see any effects with zero TVS being expected to be sold under this threshold).

Further analysing our least squares model, it is useful to look at some quality indices:
```{r,echo= FALSE, comment = NA}
reg_quality <- matrix(c(reg_sigma, reg_r2, reg_f_stat), ncol=1, nrow = 3)
colnames(reg_quality) <- c("Value")
rownames(reg_quality) <- c("RSS","R2","F-stat")
reg_quality <- as.table(reg_quality)
names(dimnames(reg_quality)) <- list("Quantity", "Table 2: Regression Quality Indices")

reg_quality
```
We have a fairly large RSS here (3.26) and this indicates that whatever the true values of the coefficients, any prediction of sales is likely to be off by 3,260 units on average. As the mean value of sales over all markets is approximately 14,000, this gives us a percentage error of 23% (An Introduction to Statistical Learning, pg 69).
Our R2 statistic gives us the proportion of variability in Sales that can be explained by TV. This shows that approximately two-thirds of Sales variability is caused by a linear regression on TV. Finally, our F-Stat gives us a highly significant p-value and so we can conclude that the difference in means between Sales and TV is statistically significant.

Here is a scatterplot detailing the showing the data and how it compares to our regression line (error for each point also drawn onto the graph):

This shows graphically that there is quite a lot of error, but also a positive correlation.

#Conclusions
According to our data, there is a positive correlation between TV and Sales of about 0.6. However, our model is by no means perfect and the simple regression has a lot of error as shown by the RSS statistic of 3.26. It would be useful if we had more data to be able to refine our model. Based on this simple analysis though, it would seem that more spending on TV advertising will result in more sales.
